# Data Science Foundations – 7 Week Practice Repository

This folder contains my **7-week data science practice work**, where I focused on building strong foundations in **Python for data analysis and basic statistics**.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process and hands-on exercises using commonly used data science libraries.

#Topics Covered

During this 7-week period, I worked on the following topics:

# Python Libraries
- **NumPy**
  - Array creation and manipulation
  - Basic mathematical operations
  - Indexing and slicing

- **Pandas**
  - DataFrames and Series
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Filtering, grouping, and basic analysis

- **Matplotlib**
  - Data visualization
  - Line plots, bar charts, histograms
  - Understanding data distributions through plots


# Statistics Basics
- Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
- Understanding data distributions
- Simple statistical interpretations for datasets



# Repository Structure
The folder includes:
- Python scripts and notebooks created during weekly exercises
- Small datasets used for practice
- Visualization examples generated with Matplotlib

Each file represents a specific topic or practice session completed during the learning process.

This repository is **educational and practice-oriented**, focusing on understanding concepts rather than building production-level projects.

*This repository reflects my learning journey as a Computer Engineering student.*
