# Data Science Foundations – 7 Week Practice Repository

This folder contains my **7-week data science practice work**, where I focused on building strong foundations in **Python for data analysis and basic statistics**.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning process and hands-on exercises using commonly used data science libraries.

## 📌 Topics Covered

During this 7-week period, I worked on the following topics:

### 🔹 Python Libraries
- **NumPy**
  - Array creation and manipulation
  - Basic mathematical operations
  - Indexing and slicing

- **Pandas**
  - DataFrames and Series
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Filtering, grouping, and basic analysis

- **Matplotlib**
  - Data visualization
  - Line plots, bar charts, histograms
  - Understanding data distributions through plots

---

## 📊 Statistics Basics
- Mean, median, variance, standard deviation
- Understanding data distributions
- Simple statistical interpretations for datasets

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
The folder includes:
- Python scripts and notebooks created during weekly exercises
- Small datasets used for practice
- Visualization examples generated with Matplotlib

Each file represents a specific topic or practice session completed during the learning process.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- Strengthen my fundamentals in data analysis
- Gain hands-on experience with core data science tools
- Build a learning-based portfolio to support internship and early-career applications

This repository is **educational and practice-oriented**, focusing on understanding concepts rather than building production-level projects.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Apply these fundamentals to small real-world datasets
- Combine data analysis skills with cybersecurity and network-related use cases
- Continue improving Python skills for automation and analysis
